# JobHuntr – A Letter from Us

Hi there!

We know—there are a lot of job tools out there. Boards, bots, extensions, AI this, AI that. It’s overwhelming. We’re not here to add to the noise. We’re building the job-hunting tool we wish we had: something that quietly works in the background, sending out smart, respectful applications while you focus on living your life.

Our mission is clear - **Resume in, interview out, 100% hand-free.**

## What JobHuntr Is (and Isn't)

JobHuntr automates job applications on first-party sites like LinkedIn. We don’t generate resumes or try to tell you who you should be. We help you apply better and faster—without spamming platforms or bending the truth.

- **✅ Personalized:** Smart filters and custom cover letters for each job.
- **❌ Resume Generator:** That’s not our thing. We believe AI-made resumes often do more harm than good.
- **🔜 What’s Next:** We’re expanding to cover more platforms like Indeed and beyond.

Here are the alternative tools we compared with, and we encourage you to explore some of them to maximize your job application efficiency and chance of getting interviews:

When it comes to platform safety, JobHuntr has a unique advantage: it operates directly from your own browser and IP address, significantly reducing the risk of detection. We also add human-like random delays between actions to mimic natural behavior. For more details, please see our Platform Letter.

As for cost, if you're using Ollama, you can run the bot locally—meaning no cloud fees, and the core functionality remains completely free.
