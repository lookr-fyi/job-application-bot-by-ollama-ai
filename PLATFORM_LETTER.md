# Open Letter to Career Platforms

Dear Career Platform Partners,

We are reaching out regarding JobHuntr.fyi, a tool designed to enhance the job-seeking experience while maintaining the integrity of your platforms. We believe in creating solutions that benefit all stakeholders in the hiring ecosystem - job seekers, employers, and platforms alike.

## Our Approach

JobHuntr.fyi is built with a fundamental principle: help job seekers focus on what truly matters while respecting platform guidelines and maintaining application quality. Our tool is not designed to flood your systems with low-quality applications, but rather to help candidates find and apply to positions where they are genuinely qualified and interested in the efficient way.

## Commitment to Responsible Automation

We have implemented several measures to ensure responsible use:

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in daily application limits to prevent platform flooding
- **Quality Filters**: Smart matching algorithms to ensure applications are only sent to relevant positions
- **Human Oversight**: All applications can be reviewed before submission
- **Platform Compliance**: Strict adherence to platform rules and guidelines
- **Anti-Spam Measures**: Prevention of duplicate applications and automated detection of already-applied positions

## Integration Possibilities

We are very interested in official integration opportunities with your platform. If you offer a Managed Client Program (MCP) or API access, we would be eager to:

1. Integrate directly with your official APIs
2. Implement any required rate limiting or compliance measures
3. Work with your team to ensure our tool enhances rather than disrupts your ecosystem
4. Share analytics and insights to help improve the job-seeking experience

## Why This Benefits Everyone

For Job Seekers:

- Focus on preparing for interviews rather than repetitive application tasks
- Better job matches through intelligent filtering
- More time for meaningful networking and skill development

For Platforms:

- Higher quality applications
- Controlled automation that respects your systems
- Better user engagement through quality matches
