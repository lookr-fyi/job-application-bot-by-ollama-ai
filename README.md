4. **Login:** Launch the app, enter your LinkedIn email, and click **“Open LinkedIn.”** Sign in to your LinkedIn account in the browser window that opens.

- **Q: Will my Linkedin account be banned?**

  No. All actions are designed to mimic human behavior, with built-in randomness. Additionally, all requests are sent from your own IP address, making it extremely difficult for LinkedIn to detect any automation.

- **Q: Why should I trust the AI’s filling?**

  By default, the AI saves all jobs to the “Queue” and marks them by confidence. The more questions you submit, the smarter it gets.

- **Q: Why is my on-device AI getting stuck on a question?**

  If you choose a model larger than 4B, some personal laptops may struggle to run it efficiently or experience significant slowdowns—especially when processing long input contexts, such as resumes. The initial response time can be particularly slow, but performance typically improves as the model continues running.

- **Q: Will it automatically follow all companies that I applied?**

  No, it will uncheck the follow option before submission by default.
