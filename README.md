- **Q: Will my Linkedin account be banned?**

  No. All actions are designed to mimic human behavior, with built-in randomness. Additionally, all requests are sent from your own IP address, making it extremely difficult for LinkedIn to detect any automation.

- **Q: Why should I trust the AI‚Äôs filling?**

  Each time the AI fills in a question, it carefully checks whether the information is available in your resume or FAQ. If not, the unseen questions are saved to your FAQ as 'unconfident,' and the current application is skipped.

- **Q: Why is my on-device AI getting stuck on a question?**

  If you choose a model larger than 4B, some personal laptops may struggle to run it efficiently or experience significant slowdowns‚Äîespecially when processing long input contexts, such as resumes. The initial response time can be particularly slow, but performance typically improves as the model continues running.

- **Q: Will it automatically follow all companies that I applied?**

  No, it will uncheck the follow option before submission by default.
