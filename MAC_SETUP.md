4. **Login:** Launch the app, enter your LinkedIn email, and click **“Open LinkedIn.”** Sign in to your LinkedIn account in the browser window that opens. Since Chromium doesn’t allow Google OAuth, Please use email to sign in instead of google. Once you're logged in, the browser will close automatically, and you'll be redirected to the Jobhuntr home page.
